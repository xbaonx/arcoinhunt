# AR Coin Hunt App (Flutter)

Material 3, Clean Architecture + BLoC + GetIt. AR via `ar_flutter_plugin`.

## Setup
```bash
cd app
flutter pub get
# Create platforms if missing
flutter create .
```

- iOS: Enable ARKit and camera permissions in Xcode project (generated by flutter create)
- Android: Ensure ARCore support and camera permission in AndroidManifest

## Run
```bash
flutter run -d <device>
```

Set backend URL via `--dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com`.

## Screens
- Map: list nearby coins (demo coords; plug Geolocator to use GPS)
- AR: renders coin.glb if provided; capture uploads to `/ar/capture`
- My NFTs: view reserved/transferred; transfer to wallet

Note: Replace `assets/models/coin.glb` with a real GLB model for full AR experience. The app will still run without it.
